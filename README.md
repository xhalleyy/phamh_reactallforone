Descriptions: Worked with and installed tailwind for styling. Used browser router to navigate through components. Added responsiveness for tablet.

Peer reviewer - Jeriah Marson

Peer reviiew - Everything looks great and all the api work and have data validation, the responsivness works too but the output box is sometimes in the way of the buttons on the bottom.
Besides that eveything looks great and works great!
